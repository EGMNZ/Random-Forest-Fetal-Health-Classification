### Random Forest Fetal Health Classification Using Streamlit

The purpose of this project was to find the best performing classifier for fetal health. Various machine learning algorithms were used. The Random Forest Classifier performed the best, and achieved the highest accuracy. A Streamlit application for frontend use was developed for users to tune various model hyperparameters to include max depth, criterion, and random state.
